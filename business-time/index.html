    <p class=bacon> Ok, it's hard to find a restaurant that serves only bacon, but it (among many other things) is on the menu at <span class=monthlyPartner> this month's Tired Cliche Food Court partner, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CuriousPigLLC/"> The Curious Pig </a></p>
    <p class=bacon> There is a certain horror-film aura to a meat restaurant being named The Curious Pig - "No, little buddy, don't go in there!" But the quality of the food and the crowds of customers have gained this restaurant a spot in Michigan news website MLive's <a href="https://www.mlive.com/life-and-culture/erry-2018/10/baaf5e10238426/these-are-the-10-best-bbq-rest.html"> Ten Best BBQ Restaurants in Michigan list.</a></p>
    <p class=bacon> Not bad, for a restaurant located waaaaaaaay up yonder in the center-western reaches of <a href="https://www.mlive.com/life-and-culture/erry-2018/10/baaf5e10238426/these-are-the-10-best-bbq-rest.html">Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</a></p>
    <p class=bacon> Mention us while you're there, and <span class="notYouGuys">  they'll make you help wash dishes  </span> you'll get a 25% discount off of anything containing bacon!</p>

    <h2>An Apple A Day...</h2>
    <img class ="cinderPic" src="http://www.cinderblockbrewery.com/images/header_logo.84a45434.png">
    <p class=apple> This might be a bit of a stretch, but stick with us here. Apples are great to eat, but they can be even better to drink.</p>
    <p class=apple> We feel that apple juice is good, but apple cider is better. And while apple cider is a winner, sometimes you might want a, um, more adult version - one with an alcohol percentage attached.</p>
    <p class=apple> This brings us to yet another of <span class=monthlyPartner> this month's Tired Cliche Food Court partner, <a href="http://www.cinderblockbrewery.com/#!/"> The Cinder Block Brewery. </a></p> 
    <p class=apple>(Note: the website asks if you are 21 or older before proceeding.)</p>
    <p class=apple> One of the more popular local breweries in the Kansas City area, Cinder Block Brewery's <a href="http://www.cinderblockbrewery.com/#!/beer"> beer page </a> features hard cider as well, including French Cider and English Cherry Cider.</p>
    <p class=apple> If you're in the Kansas City area, and have alternate arrangements for any under-21 members of your travelling party, mention us while you're there. You'll find that if you mention us, <span class="notYouGuys"> they'll throw stale marshmallows at you </span> they'll offer you a 25% discount off of either of their hard ciders.</p>
